# Pathfind-through-an-XML-map-in-C

This is a project I wrote for my university Algorithm class. The program takes an .osm file (that is obtained through openStreetMaps) and parses it so that is represented by text files. Later on, it uses linked lists and the dijkstra algorithm to determine the distance between two points.
