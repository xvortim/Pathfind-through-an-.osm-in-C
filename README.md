# Pathfind-through-an-XML-map-in-C

This is a project I wrote for my university Algorithm class. The program takes an .osm file (that is gathered from openStreetMaps) and parses it so it is is represented through text files. Later on, it uses linked lists and the dijkstra algorithm to determine the distance between two points.
